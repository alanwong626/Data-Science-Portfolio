I am originally from Hong Kong and have spent most of my teenage life studying in the UK. After completing my **Economics** degree at Bristol, I pursued a **Computer Science** master’s degree at the University of Bath. Since then, I have been working hard towards a **Data Science career** by pursuing data analytics roles in various companies. I have extensive experience **setting up data pipelines (ETL or ELT pipelines)**, dashboard building (with **Python or Power BI)**, statistical analysis and optimizing machine learning models.

Currently, I am a Data Analytics Research Assistant for the HKUST Fintech research project. I work on in-house and [commercial collaborative projects](https://bm.hkust.edu.hk/en-us/media-resources/overview/publications/reports/issue:8/) on a daily basis and have experience working with less tech-savvy audiences. I firmly believe that effectively communicating **data insight** to stakeholders is one of the most important qualities for a data scientist.

Since most of my projects are not open source, I decided it would be good to set up a personal portfolio to demonstrate my software development and data science abilities. 🔧 **As of May 2022, I am updating my portfolio daily and plan to do so in the foreseeable future.** 🔧

There are quite a few things I am passionate about, and Data Science is just one facet of my life. In my leisure time I love to play badminton, squash and snooker and watch sports such as football (Borussia Dortmund) and basketball (Warriors).

## **Power BI dashboards**

📈**Market dashboard**📉

![PBI_snapshot](img/PBI_snapshot.png)

This dashboard is an approximate replicate of one of the many dashboards I built at work. I aimed to visualize all the important market information in a single dashboard while allowing us to generate charts for daily reporting purposes quickly.

[Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMdJvjt3hBs)

[Photo Demo](https://github.com/alanwong626/Stock-Market-PowerBI/blob/main/demo/Photo%20demo/Dashboard%20Snapshots.pdf)

**Project Keywords:** Power BI, Business Intelligence, Visualization, Power BI DAX Lanauage


</br>


## **Python Data dashboard**

📈**Streamlit dashboard - A Streamlit dashboard for financial market**📉

![streamlist_snapshot](img/streamlist_snapshot.png)
While I have had extensive experience using APIs to collect market data, some of my previous colleagues are less familiar with the topic. To increase efficiency of the team, I would like to offer my expertise. This dashboard is built on Streamlit, and users can download market data with a click of a button and obtain quick visualizations for their reports!
