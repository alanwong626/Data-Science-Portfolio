# Data Science Project Portfolio

# About Me

**tldr:** Data science enthusiast with a **strong background** in the **financial market** (particularly in risk). Have extensive experience working on various **dashboard building**, **data pipeline building** and **machine learning projects** between my work experience and personal projects.

**Programming language:** Python, SQL, Power Query M, Power BI DAX

**Technologies**: [Azure cloud](https://www.credly.com/badges/b69a5b3d-8eb6-40b0-97f8-04b25f5864bb), Docker, Git, Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, Streamlit, Dash,  Basic Linux and Windows command line.

I am originally from Hong Kong and have spent most of my teenage life studying in the UK. After completing my **Economics** degree at Bristol, I pursued a **Computer Science** master’s degree at the University of Bath. Since then, I have been working hard towards a **Data Science career** by pursuing data analytics roles in various companies. I have extensive experience **setting up data pipelines (ETL or ELT pipelines)**, dashboard building (with **Python or Power BI)**, statistical analysis and optimizing machine learning models.

Currently, I am a Data Analytics Research Assistant for the HKUST Fintech research project. I work on in-house or [commercial collaborative projects](https://bm.hkust.edu.hk/en-us/media-resources/overview/publications/reports/issue:8/) on a daily basis and have experience working with less tech-savvy audiences. I firmly believe that effectively communicating **data insight** to stakeholders is one of the most important qualities for a data scientist.

Since most of my projects are not open source, I decided it would be good to set up a personal portfolio to demonstrate my software development and data science abilities. 🔧 **As of May 2022, I am updating my portfolio daily and plan to do so in the foreseeable future.** 🔧

There are quite a few things I am passionate about, and Data Science is just one facet of my life. In my leisure time I love to play badminton, squash and snooker and watch sports such as football (Borussia Dortmund) and basketball (Warriors).

## **Data visualization**

📈**Streamlit dashboard - A Streamlit dashboard for financial market**📉
**tldr:** While I have had extensive experience using APIs to collect market data, some of my pervious colleagues have less experience, so I wanted to help. This dashboard is built on Streamlit and users can download market data with click of a button and obtain quick visualizations for thier reports!
